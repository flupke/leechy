Leechy - Simple file sharing
============================

Leechy allows you to share files hosted on your server with your friends.

Installation
============

Use the ``setup.py`` script to install leechy::

    python setup.py install

You must define three settings for leechy:

``LEECHY_FILES_SOURCE``
    The folder containing the files to be served. This folder doesn't need to
    be exposed by your web server.

``LEECHY_FILES_ROOT``
    The folder that will contain the symlinks generated by leechy to the served
    files. It is advised to disable indexes in your web server config to keep
    the files private.

``LEECHY_FILES_URL``
    The URL from which the files in ``LEECHY_FILES_ROOT`` can be fetched.
