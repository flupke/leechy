Leechy - simple one-way file sharing
====================================

Leechy allows you to easilly share files hosted on your server with your
friends (and only your friends).

It works by creating an unique URL for each user, which he can use to access
your files.

Installation
------------

Use the ``setup.py`` script to install leechy::

    $ python setup.py install

You can create a virtualenv with all the required dependencies by running the
install script::

    $ ./install.sh 
    $ source venv/bin/activate

You can try leechy with the sample Django project found in ``sample_site``::

    $ cd sample_site/
    $ python manage.py syncdb
    $ python manage.py migrate
    $ python manage.py runserver    

Configuration
-------------

You must define three settings for leechy:

``LEECHY_FILES_SOURCE``
    The folder containing the files to be served. This folder doesn't have to
    be (and shouldn't be) served by your web server.

``LEECHY_FILES_ROOT``
    The folder that will contain the symlinks generated by leechy to the served
    files. It is advised to disable indexes in your web server config to keep
    the files private.

``LEECHY_FILES_URL``
    The URL from which the files in ``LEECHY_FILES_ROOT`` can be fetched.

The following optional settings can also be defined for more customization:

``LEECHY_INNKEEPER_NAME``
    The name used in emails sent by Lychee.

``LEECHY_INVITATION_SUBJECT``
    The subject of invitation emails.

``LEECHY_INVITATION_EMAIL_FROM``
    The "from" address of invitation emails.

``LEECHY_EXCLUDE_FILES``
    File and directory names matching this regular expression are not shared.
    The default is to exclude names starting with a period.

Limitations
-----------

Leechy needs symlinks and thus will only work on Unix systems.
