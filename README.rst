Leechy - simple one-way file sharing
====================================

Leechy allows you to easilly share files hosted on your server with your
friends, while keeping them private.

It works by creating an unique URL for each user, which can be used to access
your files.

Installation
============

Use the ``setup.py`` script to install leechy::

    python setup.py install

You must define three settings for leechy:

``LEECHY_FILES_SOURCE``
    The folder containing the files to be served. This folder doesn't have to
    be (and shouldn't be) served by your web server.

``LEECHY_FILES_ROOT``
    The folder that will contain the symlinks generated by leechy to the served
    files. It is advised to disable indexes in your web server config to keep
    the files private.

``LEECHY_FILES_URL``
    The URL from which the files in ``LEECHY_FILES_ROOT`` can be fetched.

You can try leechy with the Django project found in ``sample_site``::

    cd sample_site/
    python manage.py syncdb
    python manage.py runserver

Limitations
===========

Leechy needs symlinks and thus will only work on Unix systems.
